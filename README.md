## Architecture 
The Front end communicates with the users browser to figure out what the user wants to do. It communicates with cookies aswell, to see if something is stored. The front end talkes to the local storage where the OAuth tokens value is located. The frontend also talkes to the backend part of the project to be able to get all the data for the movies.
